## Publications

### [Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate Dynamics in a Behavioral Open Economy Model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199625000431)
with [Marcin Kolasa](https://sites.google.com/view/marcin-kolasa/home) and [Pawel Zabczyk](https://www.imf.org/en/Research/Researcher-CV/Author/Zabczyk-Pawel?AuthID=422#Background).  
*Journal of International Economics*, forthcoming.

We analyze the implications of adding boundedly rational agents à la Gabaix (2020) to the canonical New Keynesian open economy model. We show that accounting for myopia mitigates several “puzzling” aspects of the relationship between exchange rates and interest rates and helps explain why some of them only arise in the nested case of rational expectations.
